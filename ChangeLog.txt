Creating this file to keep track of any significant changes made to the project. That way we all know the business.
You don't have to use it but if you'd like to, then sweet.

Wed 5/4
TRyan
  Changed a few variable names just so I could follow the code more easily (will probably help Dr. Kim too so win win)
  Made a couple changes to the game logic (not much code was changed and I left the old version as a comment for now)
  
  DataModel
    - Changed playerA to playerAScore
    - Changed playerB to playerBScore
  DataModel.clicked():
    - Changed int parameter i to pit
    - Changed String variable s to stoneCount
    - Changed game rules so that if the last stone lands in a player's own Mancala, they get a 
    free turn. Otherwise, only one play is allowed per turn (other than undos).
    - Changed an "else if" to "if" to unlock the logic hidden within. Can now collect opponents 
    stones if a player's stone lands in one of their own empty pits
