Creating this file to keep track of any significant changes made to the project. That way we all know the business.
You don't have to use it but if you'd like to, then sweet.

Wed 5/4
TRyan
  Changed a few variable names just so I could follow the code more easily (will probably help Dr. Kim too so win win)
  Made a couple changes to the game logic (not much code was changed and I left the old version as a comment for now)
  
  DataModel
    - Changed playerA to playerAScore
    - Changed playerB to playerBScore
  DataModel.clicked()
    - Changed int parameter i to pit
    - Changed String variable s to stoneCount
    - Changed game rules so that if the last stone lands in a player's own Mancala, they get a 
    free turn. Otherwise, only one play is allowed per turn (other than undos).
    - Changed an "else if" to "if" to unlock the logic hidden within. Can now collect opponents 
    stones if a player's stone lands in one of their own empty pits

  Prepping for the start panel and alternate game boards
  
MancalaGUI
  - Added native look and feel to GUI
  - Added "Change Board" button to a panel with the "Quit" button (Quit button is still in the North)
  - Added temp call to the start menu so it launches with the game. We can make it a JPanel later or whatever works best

TRyan
  Hooking up start panel selections, added selection indicator for players, tweaking alternate GUIs so they swanky

  MancalaGUI
    - Moved action listener for Change Board button to Controller
    - Added title "Mancala" to the frame
    - Changed the stores (mancalas, big pits, whatever they are) back to JButtons since they fit better with the UI

  Alter[color] Buddies
    - Added some extra color changes to make the game board swanky (really just button background colors)

  StartPanelGUI
    - Added border to selected buttons so players can see their choices (wanted to do more, but time is a thing apparently...)

  DataModel
    - Added startingStones and setStartingStones(int) to support starting stone count selection
    - Added a mutator method to set the starting stone count and call update()

  Controller
    - Moved start panel button listeners to the StartPanelGUI class. Then abstracted them into the BoardSelectionPanel class so they could be reused with the StyleSelectionPanel
    - Added listener for StartPanelGUI's "Play Game" button so we can pass starting stone count to DataModel and the selected board color to MancalaGUI
