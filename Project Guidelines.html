<ul>
<li>A Weekly team report is a collection of individual weekly report of members.A team leader is responsible to collect individual reports from the members
and write a weekly team report.

<b>Do not ask for any late submission because
on-time submission is the important part of grading creteria.</b> If you missed
it by some reason, move on and make sure to submit the next one on-time. 
Although you submitted your individual report to the team leader on time
 but the leader submitted it late, it will be considered as a late submission
which will not be accepted. 

</li><li>In your individual weekly report, 
  write <b>one or two</b> lines for each day stating 
  <ol>
   <li>how many hours you worked on the project that day. (If you didn't work on the project that day, then write 0.)

  <ol>
   <li>weekly achievements 
   </li><li>issues that need to be resolved next week
